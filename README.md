# SD-Hacks-2018
## Inspiration
Many times before, we have just scanned over documents and signed where the signature was required and did not read the document. Our team members shared funny experiences with our team caused by that, which could have been prevented by a feature added-on to the signing process. We then decided to make that feature.
## What it does
Our web application, using the Gmail API locates the latest DocuSign email and presents the user all the key information about the document they are about to sign in a short and concise way.
## How we built it
We integrated the Gmail API into our base web application which would then display the user the key information that they need to know in an iframe. Then, we integrated the DocuSign API to finish the process by using the DocuSign's embedded signing feature.
## Challenges we ran into
None of our group members had experience with front end development and the process to hosting the website. Using the Gmail API to find the correct email was a challenge too.
## Accomplishments that we're proud of
As first time hackers, we are proud of the fact that we are able to turn our vision into a real working application despite having zero experience(but a lot of passion) in the field of web app design. We managed to maintain coordination in our team throughout the Hackathon and motivated each other. We were able to transition our idea into a practical plan which we were able to complete. We are proud that we learned together and taught each other.
## What we learned
We learned how to write code that can be read by multiple individuals(importance of documentation), learned how to implement Fail-Fast method to learn another language in a time effective manner. We learned how to transition an idea into a practical plan. Not only that, we enhanced our soft skills like time management, problem solving, communicating properly, troubleshooting and motivating each other.
## What's next for Ez-Read
Our product can be expand upon by including a Artificial Intelligence model which parses through the important document and finds the key information that a sender would like the signatory to definitely know about. We can further integrate this feature into DocuSign to make it included into a whole package.
